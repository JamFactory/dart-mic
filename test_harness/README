// About the driver
// =============================================================================
This is a Javascript test driver which allows for automated collection of data
from the different methods of frequency/pitch detection in the microphone.js 
library. It can be accessed via the index.html file included in this folder,
which is simply a page with a button - clicking that button runs the test
driver. The test driver writes the note data to a file "notes.txt" which shows
the FFT and autocorrelate results for each note detection side by side.

// =============================================================================
// General usage
// =============================================================================
1. Move the sound file (mp3) you wish to test into a directory with the given
	 index.html and test_driver.js.
	 
2. In the given index.html file, change the parameter of "loadAndTestWithFile"
	 to the name of the sound file you chose to test.
	 
3. Run the given index.html file. This should generate a web page with a simple
	 "TEST" button on it.
	 
4. Click the "TEST" button. This will automatically run both FFT and 
	 autocorrelate tests on the sound file you chose to test. The generated 
	 'notes.txt' file will be automatically downloaded once the tests are 
	 complete.
	 
// =============================================================================
// About the sample output
// =============================================================================
The sample output folder included in the test harness contains the following:

1. autocorr_vs_fft.png: a graphical representation of the results of the FFT and
	 autocorrelate functions on the default sound file (see #2)
	 
2. cdefgfedcgegc.mp3: the default sound file for the test harness

3. freqs.txt: a text file containing the frequencies calculated via FFT and
	 autocorrelate for the default sound file (see #2). 
	 
4. method_compare.m: This MATLAB script was used to generate the graphs in
	 autocorr_vs_fft.png. It takes the values from freqs.txt and plots them on
	 graphs as in autocorr_vs_fft.png.

5. notes.txt: a text file containing the notes calculated via FFT and 
	 autocorrelate for the default sound file (see #2)
